// “Minimum

// The previous chapter introduced the standard function Math.min that returns its smallest argument. We can do that ourselves now. Write a function min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.

// Excerpt From: Marijn Haverbeke. “Eloquent JavaScript.” iBooks.

function min(a, b) {
  if ( a < b) {
    return a;

// “We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a number is even or odd by using % 2 to check whether it’s divisible by two. Here’s another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:

// Zero is even.

// One is odd.”

// “For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.

// Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a number parameter and return a Boolean.

// Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?

// ”

  if (n == 0)
    return true;

// “Bean counting

// You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string".charAt(N), similar to how you get its length with "s".length. The returned value will be a string containing only one character (for example, "b"). The first character has position zero, which causes the last one to be found at position string.length - 1. In other words, a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.

// Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters are in the string.

// Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.”
